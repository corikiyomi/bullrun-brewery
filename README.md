# BULLRUN BREWERY
### Single page project written for ASU GIT 417 Final Project. Original HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS.

This website is for a fictional brewery in Flagstaff, AZ.

This is my first front-end project and my first time using JavaScript for a project. I will continue working on writing cleaner and more succinct code.
